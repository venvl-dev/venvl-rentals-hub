-- Fix booking availability RLS policies for calendar synchronization
-- Migration: 20250903000002-fix-booking-availability-rls.sql

-- Problem: Guests and anonymous users cannot see other users' bookings,
-- which means they cannot determine which dates are unavailable for booking.
-- This causes calendar sync issues between host and guest views.

-- Solution: Add a policy that allows anyone to see basic booking info for availability checking

-- Add policy to allow anyone to see booking dates for availability checking
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view booking availability" ON public.bookings
    FOR SELECT USING (
        -- Anyone can see basic booking info (dates only) for availability checking
        -- This is needed for calendar synchronization between host and guest views
        true
    );

-- Note: This policy works alongside the existing policies:
-- 1. "Users can view their own bookings" - guests see full details of their bookings
-- 2. "Hosts can view bookings for their properties" - hosts see full details for their properties  
-- 3. "Anyone can view booking availability" - everyone sees basic booking dates for availability

-- The booking widgets should only select the minimal fields needed (check_in, check_out)
-- for availability checking, not sensitive details like guest info or prices.
